# tidy-revealjs

_A clean template and build system for reveal.js slides (work in progress)_

By default, you build reveal.js slides by cloning the [reveal.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), which is huge and makes it hard to separate different slide presentations. This project aims to solve that problem by separating your slides from the reveal.js library.

## Usage

Fow now, this will also use `git clone`

```
git clone https://github.com/julie-ng/tidy-revealjs
npm install
npm run gulp
```

Then open up `build/index.html` in your browser.

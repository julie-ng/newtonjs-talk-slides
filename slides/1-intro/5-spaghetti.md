<img src="./images/intro/graph-4-spaghetti.png" class="img-right" alt="Introducing backends for frontends" width="600" style="margin: 0 auto">

- Really this complex?
- Really decoupled microservices?
- What happens if one is not available, e.g. "Receipts Service"?


Note:
- Decoupling trend has continued
- BFFs, Microservices, Containers, Serverless - what’s next?
- on-prem -> cloud – where’s my data?
- Failures more complex
- Debugging harder
- **How often do services really go down?**

# IETF: Standardized Health Check Format

<blockquote class="blockquote"> In distributed systems built with a number of APIs, understanding the health status of the APIs and making corresponding decisions, for caching, failover or circuit-breaking, are essential to the ability of providing <strong><em>highly-available solutions</em></strong>.</blockquote>

<cite class="center">[IETF: Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs (Internet Draft)](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-inadarei-api-health-check-02.html)</cite>

- Why Healthchecks?
	- Prefer agnostic and open-source to vendor software
	- Standard for cloud

Note:
- IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force
	- includes HTTP Working Group that maintains HTTP protocol
- Needed for autoscalers anyway
